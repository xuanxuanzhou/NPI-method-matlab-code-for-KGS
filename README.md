# NPI-method-matlab-code-for-KGS
the NPI algorithm on matlab  for the Klein-Gordon-Schrodinger equation
limit.m is for computing the limit equation
newnpi1.m newnpi2.m and newnpi3.m are the first-order, second-order and third-order npi methods, respectively.
symbolNPI.m is the file to solve the symbolic integrations.
the symboltrue.mat is the results of the symbolic intetrations for the second-order npi method.
